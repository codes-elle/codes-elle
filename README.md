## Self-Introduction

I'm Elle, a passionate software developer with a focus on cybersecurity. I started my journey on GitHub in October 2021 and have been an active contributor since then. Although relatively new to the platform, I have already created 26 public repositories, showcasing my dedication to coding and learning.

My interest in software development sparked my decision to pursue a Master's in Cybersecurity and Privacy, where I am currently honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. I am also studying for the Network+ exam to further enhance my understanding of networking concepts.

With a solid foundation in network security, incident response, and understanding of the OSI model, I'm equipped to tackle various challenges in the cybersecurity field. I have hands-on experience with firewall implementation, intrusion detection systems, and secure network architecture design.

Programming is like art to me, allowing me to create innovative solutions and streamline processes. Python has been my go-to language, leveraging its versatility to develop scripts, web applications, and perform data analysis.

JavaScript also holds a special place in my toolbox, enabling me to craft dynamic and interactive web applications. My proficiency extends to popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

I am constantly learning and actively seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding and gain practical experience aligned with my passions. As I embark on this journey, I'm eager to contribute my skills to personal and professional projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn to connect, collaborate, or discuss exciting prospects in the fascinating world of coding, software development, and cybersecurity.
